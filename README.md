# 🚦 Traffic Simulation System

> **Real-time traffic intersection simulation with intelligent vehicle behavior, collision-free operation, and interactive monitoring**
---

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Java multithreading and real-time system design by simulating a complex traffic intersection. The system manages **70+ concurrent vehicles** across multiple lanes with emergency vehicle priority, achieving **100% safety** through advanced lane filtering, vehicle behaviors, safe-distance management, and
emergency vehicle priority. 

**Production**: https://trafficflow-orpin.vercel.app/
