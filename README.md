# üö¶ Traffic Simulation System

Real-time traffic simulation with intelligent vehicle behavior, dynamic traffic management, and interactive controls.

## üöÄ Overview

This project aims to combine learning and practical application of Java core concepts and the Spring Boot framework by simulating real-world traffic scenarios in a controlled web environment. The simulation allows exploring complex and unpredictable traffic behaviors safely, providing insights and control through an interactive web interface.
